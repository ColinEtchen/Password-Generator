# Password-Generator
Homework #3

This is my Password Generator. 
You should first be brought to the main page where it asks you to fill in how long you want your password to be. 
It will then have a series of checkboxes asking you what kind of characters you want to include in the password.
Then all you have to do is press generate password and it will keep generating you a new password everytime it is pressed.

I set up the check boxes this way because I thought it would give me some extra practice with html and css and personally I think it is more asthetically pleasing.

Known issues that I encountered and would like help with is how to set the minimum amount of numbers. I couldn't get that one to stick.
